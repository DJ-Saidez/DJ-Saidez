- 👋 Hi, I’m Miles Rodriguez! (@DJ-Saidez)
- 👀 I’m interested in languages of all kinds, natural, constructed, and programming too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic PHP. I've taken an introductory Java course. In terms of languages I'm also learning Japanese, Toki Pona and Chinese.
- 💞️ I’m currently focusing on my involvement in Tatoeba, and on my learning, since I'm a full-time college student. So I wouldn't be very useful for other projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord: yako the neuromasher#5106
