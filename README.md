- 👋 Hi, I’m Miles Rodriguez! (@DJ-Saidez)
- 👀 I’m interested in languages of all kinds, natural, constructed, and programming too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic PHP, the language that Tatoeba uses. I've taken an introductory Java course. I otherwise have almost no coding ability. In terms of languages I'm also learning Japanese (conversational), Toki Pona (conversational) and Chinese (beginner).
- 💞️ I’m currently focusing on my involvement in Tatoeba, and on my learning, since I'm a full-time college student. So I wouldn't be very useful for other projects.
